#Problem Statement

Climate variability in India, including irregular rainfall and temperature changes, often results in droughts, floods, and reduced crop yields. Farmers lack an integrated system that uses existing soil and climate data to recommend suitable crops, estimate yields, and predict climate risks effectively.

#Description

This project aims to develop an AI-powered agricultural decision support system using two datasets containing soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and historical crop production records. The system will analyze these parameters to recommend appropriate crops for specific regions, predict expected yield, and classify potential climate risks such as drought and flood. By integrating these predictions, the platform will help farmers and policymakers plan agricultural activities more efficiently and minimize climate-induced losses.

#Objectives

To recommend suitable crops based on soil and climate parameters (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).
To predict agricultural yield using historical production and area data.
To classify and predict drought and flood risks using rainfall and climatic patterns.
To provide a unified decision support system for farmers and planners to enable informed and sustainable agricultural practices.
