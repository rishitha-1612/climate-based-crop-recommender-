# climate-based-crop-recommender-
AI system integrating climate, irrigation, crop yield, and market data to predict flood, drought, and rainfall patterns. Supports yield estimation and crop suitability analysis for informed agricultural planning and disaster management in India.

# problem statement
Climate variability in India significantly affects agriculture, leading to increased risks of floods, droughts, and unpredictable rainfall. These climatic extremes result in reduced crop yields, poor land utilization, and economic losses for farmers. There is a lack of an integrated system that can accurately predict these events and assist farmers in making informed decisions to minimize agricultural losses and manage disasters effectively.

# Objectives
To develop an AI-powered system for predicting flood, drought, and rainfall patterns using historical and real-time climate data.
To estimate agricultural yield based on predicted climatic conditions.
To analyze and recommend crop suitability for different regions under changing climate scenarios.
To provide a unified platform that supports farmers and policymakers in disaster preparedness and sustainable agricultural planning.
To enhance climate risk management by integrating multi-factor predictions for effective decision-making.
