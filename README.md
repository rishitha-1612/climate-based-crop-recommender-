# Problem Statement

Unpredictable rainfall, changing temperature, and soil nutrient imbalance in India affect agricultural productivity and crop selection. Farmers often lack a reliable system to recommend suitable crops, estimate yields, and assess drought risks using available soil and climate data.

# Objectives

To recommend suitable crops based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
To predict agricultural yield using historical production and area data.
To identify drought risk using rainfall and climatic conditions.
To provide a data-driven decision support system for farmers and planners.

# Description

This project is a machine learning-based agricultural decision support system that helps farmers and planners make informed decisions.
It analyzes soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall patterns to recommend the most suitable crops for a given region.
The system also predicts agricultural yield using historical production and area data.
Additionally, it assesses drought risk based on rainfall thresholds, enabling proactive planning and resource allocation.
